"Mammogram analysis depends mainly on the experience of the
radiologist, and is also affected by his fatigue and other factors.This means that an automated
process for image analysis should be considered, when working
with mammographic images. A good automated system should
be able to make automated image analysis and enable an
efficient classification on the examined tissue";Kitanovski, I. et al. Comparison of feature extraction algorithms for mammography images Shanghai: IEEE ;2011;Lembrar de pegar parte em que os resulttados de um CAD servem como uma seguranca para que o medico especialista dë a palavra final;
We are using five different feature descriptors: GLDM (Gray Level Difference Method), LBP (Local Binary Patterns), GLRLM (Grey Level Run Length Method), Haralick and Gabor texture features;Kitanovski, I. et al.

Breast cancer is an important risk that must be concerned by everyone around the world. With almost 1.7 million new cases diagnosed in 2012, breast cancer is the most common form of cancer around the world;Ferlay, J. et al. GLOBOCAN 2012 v1.1, Cancer Incidence and Mortality Worldwide: IARC CancerBase No. 11;2012;;
Cancer is a disease caused by the changes occurred in cells spread uncontrollably. Mostly cancer cells forms a lump or mass which is called tumor and named after the part of body in which it originates. Breast cancer usually produces no pain at its early stage when it is easily treated, that’s why screening is important for early detection.;"Charan, S.; Muhammad, J.

and cystic masses may also have poorly defined margins";"Homer, M. J. Mammographic Interpretation: A Practical Approach.

"When implementing a
computer-aided detection system (CAD), one of the main
points that should be considered very seriously is the selection
of appropriate features that could be used to distinguish
between benignancy and malignancy.";"A Novel Method of Extracting and Classifying the

"Modern scanners have much higher resolution than earlier
devices, which has improved the ability to describe some

a tumor";"A Novel Method of Extracting and Classifying the

"Benign lesions form a pseudocapsule that prevents the
tumor from invading the surrounding normal tissues.
Therefore, benign masses always have well-defined contours
with rounder, smoother shapes. By comparison, the contours of
malignant tumors are poorly defined and irregular";Tang J S, Rangayyan R M, Xu J, et al. Computer-Aided Detection and Diagnosis of Breast Cancer with Mammography: Recent Advances [J]. IEEE Transactions on Information Technology in Biomedicine. 2009, 13(2):236-251.;2009;;

not a comprehensive approach because no information is

"Mass density can be high, isodense, low, and fat

micro-lobulated, indistinct, and spiculated. Finally, mass shape can be round, oval, lobular, and irregular";J. Bozek, M. Mustra, K.Delac, and M. Grgic, .A survey of image processing algorithms in digital mammography,. J. Recent Advances in Multimedia Signal Processing and Communications, vol. 231, pp. 631. 657, 2009.;2009;;
"The quality of a feature is related to its ability to
discriminate observations from different classes. The
description task often generates a large number of features
and the obtained feature space may include a large number of
irrelevant features. This will induce greater computational
cost, occupy a lot of storage space and decrease the
classification performance.";Image Features Extraction for Masses Classification in Mammograms;2014;;
